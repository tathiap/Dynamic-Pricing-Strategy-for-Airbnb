# Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy-for-Airbnb

## Overview
An Airbnb property management firm wants to develop a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize their rental pricing based on various factors like demand, location, property type, seasonality, competitor pricing, and market trends. The goal is to adjust the price of listings in real-time, ensuring maximum occupancy while also maximizing revenue for hosts.

## Objective
* To create a dynamic pricing model that adjusts Airbnb rental prices based on different factors such as market demand, local events, historical data, and competitor pricing.
* To analyze how pricing affects occupancy rates, total revenue, and customer satisfaction.
* To provide data-driven insights to property managers and hosts about when to raise or lower their prices, and by how much, to stay competitive.

## Key Metrics to Analyze
1. Occupancy Rate: Percentage of nights booked relative to available nights.
2. Average Daily Rate (ADR): Average price charged per night.
3. Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): This combines occupancy and ADR, helping to measure the overall financial performance.
4. Booking Lead Time: Average number of days before a booking occurs (can inform pricing adjustments as bookings get closer).
5. Seasonality: Fluctuations in booking trends throughout the year, e.g., holidays, weekends, or off-peak seasons.
6. Competitor Pricing: Analyze how similar properties in the area are priced.
7. Guest Reviews & Ratings: A measure of the propertyâ€™s popularity and its effect on pricing decisions.
8. Local Events & Holidays: Special events (concerts, sports games, festivals) that might influence demand and allow for price adjustments.
